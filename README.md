Ransomware Simulation Project
=============================

Overview
--------

This project demonstrates a simple ransomware simulation that targets `.txt` files on the desktop, encrypts them, and changes the desktop wallpaper. It also generates a decryption executable to restore the encrypted files. This project is intended for educational purposes only and should be executed in a controlled, isolated virtual machine environment.

Features
--------

-   Encrypts all `.txt` files on the desktop and renames them with a custom extension.
-   Creates a ransom note on the desktop with the encryption key and a random encryption code.
-   Changes the desktop wallpaper to a specified image.
-   Attempts to disable Windows Defender (not guaranteed to work on all systems).
-   Adds persistence by creating a scheduled task to run the ransomware executable on logon.
-   Generates a decryption executable on the desktop to decrypt the encrypted files.

Requirements
------------

-   Python 3.x
-   `cryptography` library
-   `PyInstaller` for packaging scripts into executables

Installation
------------

1.  **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Open a command line or terminal and run:

    bash

    Copy code

    `pip install cryptography`

Usage
-----


2.  **Run the Packaging Script**: Open your command line or terminal, navigate to the directory containing both scripts, and run:

```bash
    python package_script.py
```

3.  **Executable Output**: After running the packaging script, you should see an executable file named `encrypt_desktop_files.exe` in the same directory.

### 3\. Running the Encryption Executable

1.  **Place the Executable on the Target Machine**: Ensure the `encrypt_desktop_files.exe` is placed on the target machine's desktop.

2.  **Run the Executable**: Double-click the `encrypt_desktop_files.exe` to run it. This will encrypt all `.txt` files on the desktop, change the wallpaper, attempt to disable Windows Defender, and create a decryption executable on the desktop.

3.  **Check the Log File**: After running the executable, check the `encryption_log.txt` on the desktop for logs of the encryption process to debug any issues.

### 4\. Decrypting the Files

1.  **Locate the Decryption Executable**: The decryption executable named `decrypt_files.exe` will be created on the desktop.

2.  **Run the Decryption Executable**: Double-click the `decrypt_files.exe` to run it. This will decrypt all `.enc` files on the desktop using the provided encryption key.

3.  **Verify Decryption**: After running the decryption executable, the `.enc` files on the desktop should be decrypted and restored to their original `.txt` format.
